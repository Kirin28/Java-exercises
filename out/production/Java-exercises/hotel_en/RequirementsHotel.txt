REQ-1 After startup, the desired number of rooms has to be requested. This has to be an integer in the range of 1 to 18.

REQ-2 Once the user has entered the desired number of hotel rooms, he shall be taken to the Main Menu. All rooms start out empty.

REQ-3 In the main menu the user will get to see an overview of all rooms and any guests staying in each one (REQ-4).
From here, the user can choose between three actions:
	1. Register a new guest (REQ-5)
	2. Deregister a current guest (REQ-7)
	3. Stop (REQ-8)

REQ-4 The overview of rooms shall show the following information:
	If no guest is currently registered for this room: "<room number>: empty"
	If a guest is registered for this room: "<room number>: <name> <gender> <age> <age status> <veg status>"
	Where:
		<room number> = "Room ", followed by the number of the room
		<name> = name of the guest
		<gender> = {"M" | "F"}
		<age> = "age: ", followed by the age of the guest
		<age status> = {"(toddler)" (for age below 5) | "(child)" (for age 5 to 17) | "(65+)" (for age 65 or greater) | "" (any other age)}
		<veg status> = "(vegetarian)" if guest is vegetarian, nothing otherwise

REQ-5 If there are empty rooms available, the user can register a new guest. The user shall then be requested to enter the following information:
		- the name of the guest (can be an arbitrary string)
		- the gender of the guest (either "M" or "F"; input shall be case insensitive)
		- the age of the guest (A positive integer, less than 150)
		- whether the guest is a vegetarian (either "Y" or "N"; input shall be case insensitive)
		- the number of the room to register the guest for (an integer within the range of the existing room numbers, subject to REQ-6)
	After succesfully completing a Register action, the user shall return to the Main Menu (REQ-3).
	
REQ-6 An existing guest registration cannot be overwritten by a new Register action.
	In case a user picks a room that is already full during a Register action, the user shall be informed that this is not allowed. In that case, the
	overview shall be shown again (REQ-4) and the user shall be requested to choose a different room number, subject to the same restrictions (see REQ-5)
	If the user tries to perform a Register action while there are no free rooms, the Register action shall not be executed. The user shall then be informed
	that it is impossible to register any more guests and the user shall return to the Main Menu (REQ-3).

REQ-7 If the user deregisters a guest, he shall be requested to enter the number of the room of the guest he wants to deregister.
	If the room with that number is already empty, the user shall be informed that the room is empty and return to the Main menu (REQ-3).
	If there is a guest registered for the room, the registration shall be removed.
	After completing a Deregister action, the user shall return to the Main Menu (REQ-3).

REQ-8 If the user selects the Stop action from the Main Menu, the program shall be terminated.
